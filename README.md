## New-Zealand-Industry-Financial-Health-Dashboard-2013-2024 
Measuring Profitability, Growth, and Financial Stability Across NZ Industries
This project analyses New Zealand industry-level financial performance and financial position over the period 2013–2024, using official data from Statistics New Zealand. The dashboard brings together income, expenditure, profitability, liquidity, and balance-sheet indicators to understand how industries have grown, how efficiently they generate profit, and how financially resilient they are.

At an overall level, industries in New Zealand have shown steady growth in total income over time, with expenditure rising alongside it. While profitability has improved in recent years, it has not been uniform across industries. Financial and property-related sectors consistently emerge as high-margin industries, while many production-heavy and service-oriented industries operate on thin margins.

The analysis highlights an important trade-off:
industries with high profitability are not always the most financially stable, and industries with strong liquidity do not always generate high returns. This balance between profitability and financial safety becomes clear when viewing industries on a combined margin-vs-liquidity scatter view.

A drill-through industry detail page allows stakeholders to explore full financial statements per industry, including income composition, cost structure, assets, liabilities, and key ratios. This makes the dashboard useful not just for high-level insight, but also for industry benchmarking, policy analysis, and strategic decision-making.

## Macro Financial Trends (Time-Series Dashboard) 
Income & Expenditure Growth

Across the time-series visuals, total income shows a consistent upward trend from 2013 to 2024, indicating long-term economic expansion across industries. Total expenditure also rises steadily, closely tracking income.

# Key insight:
Industries are growing, but cost structures are expanding at almost the same pace — meaning growth alone does not guarantee higher profitability.

Operating Surplus (Profit Retained)

Operating surplus increases over time but shows periodic dips, particularly around major economic disruptions. This indicates that while industries are generally profitable, profitability is sensitive to external shocks.

# Take Away 1: Industries make more money today than a decade ago, but they don’t keep all of it — cost pressures matter.

Operating Margin %

Operating margin fluctuates rather than rising smoothly. Some years show strong efficiency gains, while others show margin compression.
Operating margin tells us how efficiently income is converted into profit. Flat or volatile margins mean industries must work harder to protect profitability as they grow.

Current Ratio (Financial Safety)

The current ratio remains relatively stable across years, suggesting that industries generally maintain short-term financial safety, even when profitability fluctuates.

# Interpretation:
New Zealand industries tend to manage liquidity conservatively, ensuring they can meet short-term obligations. New Zealand industries tend to manage liquidity conservatively, ensuring they can meet short-term obligations.

# Which Industries Are Most Profitable?

From the ranked operating margin charts: 
Financial Asset Investing
Property Operators
Finance & Insurance-related services
consistently show higher operating margins than most other industries. Meanwhile, industries such as: Manufacturing, Transport, Retail, Primary production , operate on much thinner margins.

# Interpretation:
Capital- and asset-light industries tend to be more profitable than labour- or cost-intensive ones.

## Key Takeaways

Industry income in New Zealand has grown steadily (2013–2024), but rising expenditure has limited profit expansion, keeping margins under pressure.

Financial, investment, and property-related industries are the most profitable, while many large, operational industries run on thin margins.

High profitability does not always mean financial stability — several high-margin industries show lower liquidity levels.

Most industries maintain adequate short-term financial safety, as reflected by stable current ratios over time.

Economic value is concentrated in a small number of industries, increasing exposure to sector-specific shocks.

## Recommendations

Evaluate industries using both profitability and liquidity, not margin alone, to avoid hidden financial risk.

Low-margin industries should prioritise cost efficiency and productivity improvements over revenue growth.

Use drill-through analysis for benchmarking, enabling deeper, evidence-based comparisons across industries.

Future enhancements could include YoY growth indicators and performance-risk categorisation for clearer decision support.
