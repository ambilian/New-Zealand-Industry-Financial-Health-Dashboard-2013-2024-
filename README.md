# 🇳🇿 New Zealand Industry Financial Health Dashboard (2013–2024)

**Measuring profitability, growth, and financial stability across New Zealand industries**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyses **industry-level financial performance and financial position in New Zealand** over the period **2013–2024**, using official data from **Statistics New Zealand**.

The dashboard brings together:
- Income and expenditure
- Profitability metrics
- Liquidity indicators
- Balance sheet measures

to understand:
- How industries have grown over time  
- How efficiently they convert income into profit  
- How financially resilient they are  

The analysis supports **industry benchmarking, policy analysis, and strategic decision-making**.

---

## 📊 Key Insights at a Glance

- New Zealand industries show **steady income growth** over time, with expenditure rising alongside it.
- Profitability has improved in recent years but **varies significantly across industries**.
- Financial and property-related sectors consistently emerge as **high-margin industries**.
- Production-heavy and service-oriented industries generally operate on **thin margins**.
- **Profitability and financial stability do not always move together** — a key insight highlighted in the dashboard.

## 🔍 Macro Financial Trends (Time-Series Analysis)

### Income & Expenditure Growth
Total income trends upward from 2013 to 2024, indicating long-term economic expansion across industries.  
Total expenditure closely follows income growth.

**Key Insight:**  
> Industries are growing, but cost structures are expanding at almost the same pace — growth alone does not guarantee higher profitability.

---

### Operating Surplus (Profit Retained)
Operating surplus increases over time but shows **periodic dips**, especially around economic disruptions.

**Takeaway:**  
> Industries make more money today than a decade ago, but they don’t keep all of it — cost pressures matter.

---

### Operating Margin (%)
Operating margins fluctuate rather than increasing smoothly. Some years show efficiency gains, while others show margin compression.

**Interpretation:**  
> As industries grow, they must work harder to protect profitability.

---

### Current Ratio (Financial Safety)
The current ratio remains relatively stable across years.

**Interpretation:**  
> New Zealand industries generally manage liquidity conservatively and maintain the ability to meet short-term obligations.

---

## 🏭 Which Industries Are Most Profitable?

Based on ranked operating margin analysis:

**High-margin industries include:**
- Financial Asset Investing
- Property Operators
- Finance and Insurance-related services

**Lower-margin industries include:**
- Manufacturing
- Transport
- Retail
- Primary production

**Insight:**  
> Capital- and asset-light industries tend to outperform labour- and cost-intensive industries in profitability.

## 🔎 Industry Deep Dive (Drill-Through Analysis)

A drill-through industry detail page allows users to explore **full financial breakdowns per industry**, including:
- Income composition
- Cost structure
- Assets and liabilities
- Profitability and liquidity ratios

This enables both **high-level insights** and **granular industry benchmarking**.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- Industry income in New Zealand has grown steadily (2013–2024), but rising expenditure has limited profit expansion.
- Financial, investment, and property-related industries are the most profitable.
- High profitability does not always mean strong financial stability.
- Most industries maintain adequate short-term liquidity.
- Economic value is concentrated in a small number of industries, increasing exposure to sector-specific risks.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Evaluate industries using **both profitability and liquidity**, not margin alone.
- Low-margin industries should focus on **cost efficiency and productivity improvements**.
- Use drill-through analysis for **evidence-based benchmarking**.
- Future enhancements could include **YoY growth indicators** and **performance-risk categorisation**.
