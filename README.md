## 🧾 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

This project analyses New Zealand industry-level financial performance and financial position over the period 2013–2024, using official data from Statistics New Zealand. The dashboard brings together income, expenditure, profitability, liquidity, and balance-sheet indicators to understand how industries have grown, how efficiently they generate profit, and how financially resilient they are.

At an overall level, industries in New Zealand have shown steady growth in total income over time, with expenditure rising alongside it. While profitability has improved in recent years, it has not been uniform across industries. Financial and property-related sectors consistently emerge as high-margin industries, while many production-heavy and service-oriented industries operate on thin margins.

The analysis highlights an important trade-off:
industries with high profitability are not always the most financially stable, and industries with strong liquidity do not always generate high returns. This balance between profitability and financial safety becomes clear when viewing industries on a combined margin-vs-liquidity scatter view.

A drill-through industry detail page allows stakeholders to explore full financial statements per industry, including income composition, cost structure, assets, liabilities, and key ratios. This makes the dashboard useful not just for high-level insight, but also for industry benchmarking, policy analysis, and strategic decision-making.

## 📊 Key Insights at a Glance

- New Zealand industries show **steady income growth** over time, with expenditure rising alongside it.

## 🔍 Macro Financial Trends (Time-Series Analysis)

### Income & Expenditure Growth
Total income trends upward from 2013 to 2024, indicating long-term economic expansion across industries.  
Total expenditure closely follows income growth.

**Key Insight:**  
> Industries are growing, but cost structures are expanding at almost the same pace — growth alone does not guarantee higher profitability.

---

### Operating Surplus (Profit Retained)
Operating surplus increases over time but shows **periodic dips**, especially around economic disruptions.

**Takeaway:**  
> Industries make more money today than a decade ago, but they don’t keep all of it — cost pressures matter.

---

### Operating Margin (%)
Operating margins fluctuate rather than increasing smoothly. Some years show efficiency gains, while others show margin compression.

**Interpretation:**  
> As industries grow, they must work harder to protect profitability.

---

### Current Ratio (Financial Safety)
The current ratio remains relatively stable across years.

**Interpretation:**  
> New Zealand industries generally manage liquidity conservatively and maintain the ability to meet short-term obligations.

**High-margin industries include:**
- Financial Asset Investing
- Property Operators
- Finance and Insurance-related services

**Lower-margin industries include:**

## 🔎 Industry Deep Dive (Drill-Through Analysis)

A drill-through industry detail page allows users to explore **full financial breakdowns per industry**, including:
- Income composition
- Cost structure
- Assets and liabilities
- Profitability and liquidity ratios

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- Industry income in New Zealand has grown steadily (2013–2024), but rising expenditure has limited profit expansion.
- Financial, investment, and property-related industries are the most profitable.
- High profitability does not always mean strong financial stability.
- Most industries maintain adequate short-term liquidity.
- Economic value is concentrated in a small number of industries, increasing exposure to sector-specific risks.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Evaluate industries using **both profitability and liquidity**, not margin alone.
- Low-margin industries should focus on **cost efficiency and productivity improvements**.
- Use drill-through analysis for **evidence-based benchmarking**.
- Future enhancements could include **YoY growth indicators** and **performance-risk categorisation**.
